Java based Offline Rekening Overzicht

Project is inspired by the Dutch program Offline Rekening Overzicht (Orov). This program allows users 
to import online bankstatements and catagorize the spending/income into groups. The original programs 
was not open source and is no longer maintained. The introduction of the SEPA releated IBAN bankaccount
numbers causes the program to no longer work properly.


Aim is to replace the main functions of the original with a Java Swing application.

First step is to create the GUI using the WindowBuilder in Eclipse.

Basic build system based on Gradle.
